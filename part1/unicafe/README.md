## 1.6: unicafe step 1

Like most companies, the student restaurant of the University of Helsinki Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. Your task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

## 1.7: unicafe step 2

Expand your application so that it shows more statistics about the gathered feedback: the total number of collected feedback, the average score (good: 1, neutral: 0, bad: -1) and the percentage of positive feedback.

## 1.8: unicafe step 3

Refactor your application so that displaying the statistics is extracted into its own Statistics component. The state of the application should remain in the App root component.

## 1.9: unicafe step 4
Change your application to display statistics only once feedback has been gathered.
